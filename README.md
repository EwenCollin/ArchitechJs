# ArchitechJs
Architecture tool to make 3D buildings made by Ewen Collin. Its goal is to quickly prototype buildings.

Inspired by NEM (Nested Explorative Maps by Pauline Olivier, Renaud Chabrier, Damien Rohmer, Eric de Thoisy, Marie-Paule Cani. Nested Explorative Maps: A new 3D canvas for conceptual design in architecture. Computers and Graphics, Elsevier, 2019, Special Section on SMI 2019, pp.203-213. ff10.1016/j.cag.2019.05.027ff. ffhal-02158131).

## How to use

 - clone this repo locally
 - run http-server
 - go to localhost:8080 on your browser

### To create forms

 - use Z (azerty keyboard) or W (qwerty keyboard) to create 3D form (keep pressed to change size)
 - use A (azerty keyboard) or Q (qwerty keyboard) to draw (3D lines)

## Library used in this web app

 - ThreeJs r124
 - ThreeJs-CSG (TS version)

The whole code added is in the main.js file (all the logic of the 3D editor). This may be changed in the future if I make updates.
